The following User Agreement ("User Agreement") governs the conditions how this Website and the services ("Service") may be used.
          By your use of this Website and our Service you agree with and accept the following User Agreement. If you do not agree with this User Agreement, do not use this Website or the Service available through it.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside>
        <h3>OVERVIEW OF THE SERVICE</h3>
        <p>The Service allows people to send money to many different countries around the world. We recommend that you use the Service only to send money to people you know personally. You should never use the Service to send money to strangers.  Please refer to Frauds and Scams section below.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside>
        <h3>DEFINITIONS</h3>
        <p> A <strong>"Money Transfer"</strong> is defined as the transmission of funds to a designated Beneficiary, pursuant to payment terms entered directly by you into the Website. A <strong>"Sender"</strong> is someone who uses the Service to send money. A <strong>"Beneficiary"</strong> is someone who receives money from a Sender through the Service. The <strong>"Destination Country"</strong> is the country where the Recipient receives money through the Service. A <strong>"Transaction"</strong> is a specific instruction to send money through the Service. A <strong>"Paying Agent"</strong> is defined as an entity, appointed by us, to pay out Money Transfer transactions in the Destination Country identified in your payment instructions. <strong>"Service Fee"</strong> is defined as the fee charged by us in connection with the Money Transfer.  The <strong>"Transaction Amount"</strong> is the calculated amount that the Sender would be obliged to pay to UniTeller if the Sender orders the Transaction (and is the amount that the Sender is then obliged to pay UniTeller). The <strong>"Payout Amount"</strong> is the amount paid out to the Recipient, excluding any taxes or charges that may be levied under the laws of the Destination Country (the <strong>"Local Taxes"</strong>). </p>

        <h3>ACCESSING THE WEBSITE AND SECURITY</h3>
        <p>By using this Website, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years or older and of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right at any time to withdraw or amend this Website, and any service or material we provide on the Website, in our sole discretion without notice, except as otherwise required by law. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Website, or the entire Website, to users, including, but not limited to registered users.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Website and for maintaining the necessary hardware and software to use the Service.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Website through your mobile phone device or internet connection are aware of the terms of this User Agreement, have agreed to such terms, and that they will comply with them.
          To access the Website or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide certain registration, identification and authentication details or other information. It is a condition of your use of the Website that all the information you provide to us on the Website (or otherwise) is correct, current and complete at all times.</p>
        <p>If you become a registered user of our Service and you choose, or you are provided with, a user name, password, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any third party.

      <aside>
        <h3>VALIDATION OF PAYMENT SOURCE AND PAYMENT</h3>
        <p><strong>Validation of Payment Source</strong> When you make a Transaction using the Service, you authorize UniTeller to perform a validation of the source of the funds (i.e. bank account, credit card or debit card).  This authorization allows UniTeller to add and/or to subtract two separate small amounts of money (usually less than $0.20) from that bank account, credit card or debit card to validate that this is the correct source for your funds and the account number is correct.  You will then be required to submit to the UniTeller system through your profile the exact amounts of those two transfers in order to validate that source of funds.</p>
        <p><strong>Charges</strong> For each Transaction that you submit, you agree to pay us a service fee (the "Service Fee") plus the Transaction Amount. Additional charges may apply. Payment in full is due at the time your Transaction is submitted for processing.  UniTeller only accepts payment in U.S. Dollars. If you submit a Transaction that results in UniTeller being charged non-sufficient fund fees, chargeback fees, or any other fees, you agree to reimburse us for all such fees. You agree that UniTeller at its option may debit your bank account or credit card/debit card for less than the amount of the transfer (i.e., for a transfer of $500, UniTeller may debit $499.98 from such account), as part of our effort to confirm ownership of the account.</p>
        <p><strong>Payment</strong> for Transactions In order for us to collect payment from you, you authorize us to access, charge, or debit funds from any of the payment instruments you provide us in connection with your use of the Service (each, a "Payment Instrument") including, for example, your credit card, debit card or bank account. If your payment fails or is insufficient, you authorize us to re-try one or more times using the same or a different Payment Instrument. For example, if there are insufficient funds in your bank account at the time you submit your Transaction, we may try to debit your bank account or charge your credit card at a later time(s). You represent and warrant that you are the lawful owner of your Payment Instrument(s) and can make these authorizations.</p>
        <p><strong>Other Charges</strong> UniTeller is not responsible for any fees or charges that may be imposed by the financial institutions associated with your Payment Instruments. For example (without limitation), some credit card issuers may treat the use of your credit card to use the Service as a <strong>"cash advance"</strong> rather than a purchase transaction, and may impose additional fees and interest rates for the transaction. UniTeller is not responsible for any non-sufficient funds charges, chargeback fees, or any other charges that might be imposed on you by your bank, credit card issuer, or other provider. </p>
      </aside>
      <aside>

        <h3>FRAUDS AND SCAMS</h3>
        <p>HELP PREVENT CONSUMER FRAUD!  Are you sending money to claim lottery or prize winnings, or on a promise of receiving  money? (2) Are you sending money because you were guaranteed a credit card or loan? (3) Are you responding to an Internet or phone offer that you are not sure is honest? (4) Are you sending money to someone you do not know or whose identity you can’t verify? (5) Are you sending money to someone (particularly if outside the country) who claims to be a relative needing cash for an emergency?   If so, do NOT send the money or, if you have, ask our customer service agents to request to stop your transfer immediately, or call UniTeller at 1-800-456-3492. If your money has not been picked up yet (or otherwise taken), we will process the return for you.  Once your Transaction has been picked up, which can happen in a short time, you cannot receive a refund, even if someone stole this money through fraud.</p>
